ERROR =============================================================================================================================>>
When you getting npm package outdateed error then you should use these commands
npm outdated
npm update

While trying to fix the errors (I am also working on the same project), I used the commands npm outdated then npm update to update all packages listed in the package.json file. I then run npx expo-doctor to diagnose and troubleshoot other issues and found none.

1. for refresh page we need to use a component called as :- <ScrollView></ScrollView> (As parent div)
inside this now we can provide refresh comp to handle refresh :-  that will look like :- (
                refreshControl={<RefreshControl
                    refreshing={refreshing}
                    onRefresh={onRefresh}
                />}
)
By above way we setup to refesh page.
